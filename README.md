## ðŸ”§ Description

The **smartloadmanager** adapter is used for dynamic control of loads based on a PV feed-in value. The goal is to consume surplus electricity locally, thus minimizing or completely avoiding feed-in to the public grid. It supports both on/off loads and percentage-controlled devices and battery storage.
